## NOTES

-----------
INSTRUCTIONS:
Use this markdown file to keep track of open questions/challenges from this week's assignment.
- What did you have trouble solving? Could not create label for axes (I had to use a work-around for the x axis and was not able to create one for the Y axis). Was not able to interactively transform the line into an area chart.
- What went easier than expected? Finding a datasest and styling text + titles was pretty straightforward
- What, if anything, is currently blocking you? I do not fully understand the code structure in JS, I proceed by attempting different things.  

Sometimes it helps to formulate what you understood and where you got stuck in order to move forward. Feel free to include `code snippets`, `screenshots`, and `error message text` here as well.

If you find you're not able complete this week's assignment, reflecting on where you are getting stuck here will help you get full credit for this week's tutorial
