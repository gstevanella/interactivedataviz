## NOTES

-----------
INSTRUCTIONS:
Use this markdown file to keep track of open questions/challenges from this week's assignment.
- What did you have trouble solving? Not sure I interpreted the data correctly, I think this is because I could not understand the use of BioId in class whilst we did the live example.
I was not able to show the label for the axes. I checked several websites, but whatever route I chose, the vertical lable would not display. I was not able to create a legend, I had to use an HTML workaround. 
- What went easier than expected?
- What, if anything, is currently blocking you? As per my other notes, I am struggling with the code structure, especially when it comes to understand how the various elements interact with one another. 

Sometimes it helps to formulate what you understood and where you got stuck in order to move forward. Feel free to include `code snippets`, `screenshots`, and `error message text` here as well.

If you find you're not able complete this week's assignment, reflecting on where you are getting stuck here will help you get full credit for this week's tutorial
