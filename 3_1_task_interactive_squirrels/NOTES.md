## NOTES

-----------
INSTRUCTIONS:
Use this markdown file to keep track of open questions/challenges from this week's assignment.
- What did you have trouble solving? I find margins very confusing, I had to go through several attempts before being able to make the barchart move horizontally
- What went easier than expected? 
- What, if anything, is currently blocking you? I do not fully understand the code structure and why certain steps are needed. I watch tutorials and read articles online, however people appear to have very different way of creating charts

Sometimes it helps to formulate what you understood and where you got stuck in order to move forward. Feel free to include `code snippets`, `screenshots`, and `error message text` here as well.

If you find you're not able complete this week's assignment, reflecting on where you are getting stuck here will help you get full credit for this week's tutorial
